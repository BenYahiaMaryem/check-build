**Check-build** verify that your NodeJS project follow team conventions, is well written and secure.

A NodeJS project can be automatically analyzed in many dimension like code-consistency, d-r-y-ness and security. Check-build final goal is to make the human out of the loop.

# Usage

```shell
npm install check-build -g
cd /path/to/your/project
check-build
# [...] (sub-module output)
echo $?
# 0 if everything went right, 1 otherwise.
```

# What's inside 

### Code error and potential problem detection

- [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint) Static analysis tool for JavaScript (using [JSHint stylish](https://github.com/sindresorhus/jshint-stylish))

*[To be implemented]*: [FixMyJS](https://github.com/jshint/fixmyjs) Automatically fix silly lint errors.

### Code style checking

- [JSCS](https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs) Check the code style of your code.

### D.R.Y

- [JSInspect](https://www.npmjs.org/package/jsinspect) Detect structural similarities in your code.
- [buddy.js](https://github.com/danielstjules/buddy.js) Detect magic number in your code.

### Security

- [Nsp](https://github.com/nodesecurity/nsp) Check your project dependencies for security issues.

# Philosophy

- Leverage simplicity over performance. `check-build` will be run automatically by a build bot. I #%£€)° don't care about performance, I want code quality and ease of use.
- Don't reinvent the wheel, leverage each module own configuration file. E.g. `.jshintrc`.
- Even if the underneath module is not capable of handling multiple files, abstract it.
- Use `multimatch` everywhere.
- `.checkbuild` is there to configure each module (if necessary), checkbuild will forward these parameters to each module implementation.

# Todo

- Fork jsinspect to read a `.jsinspect` file
- Fork buddyjs to read a `.buddyjs` file
